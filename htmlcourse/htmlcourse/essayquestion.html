    <h1>Should Web Page Authors Use Non-Standard Additions to HTML ?</h1>
    <p>
        In my opinion web page authors should try to use the standards set by the W3C when developing web pages. I feel this way for a few reasons. First of all browsers are now designed with these standards in mind, and if you put something in your code that is not a standard, it might not work on all browsers. If a technology is not supported on some browsers then when a user tries to access the site, it might just crash. This makes the internet unreliable.
    </p>
    <p>
        Secondly, without standardization, it can be difficult for other developers to come in and understand your code, making it difficult to maintain.

        Also standardization ensures that accommodations are made for people with disabilities, when the Web adheres to standards, it is accessible to people with a diverse range of hearing, movement, sight, and cognitive ability. For example, the alt attribute gives a description of images for people using screen readers so they donâ€™t have to be able to see images to know what the website is about.  This attribute is recommended by the W3C when designing websites.
    </p>
    <p>
        Another reason for standardization is we want the web to be accessible to all, meaning all types of technology, countries, companies and people. Therefore some type of standardization is needed so people can develop technology and be confident it will work on all platforms, because they know everyone is adhering to specific guidelines. For example if a developer puts something on their website that is not standardized then people that use a browser that is old or not compatible with that technology, will not be able to access that service or information. That limits people from accessing that website. The goal of the internet is to make information and technology available to everyone. That was what Tim Berners-Lee had in mind when he envisioned the internet.
